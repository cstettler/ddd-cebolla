# ddd-cebolla
lightweight framework for building applications following the ideas of ddd and onion architecture


## Goal
The project aims to provide a lightweight, yet powerful framework for building applications based on the concepts of domain-driven design and following the onion architecture approach. The ddd-cebolla framework aims to stay as non-invasive and technology-independent as possible, while still providing out-of-the-box support for all relevant architectural concepts of domain-driven design.

The ddd-cebolla framework does not strictly follow principles such as CQRS or Event Sourcing, but applies a pragmatic approach to implementing domain-driven design that is not "radical" and thus, should also be applicable in more traditional enterprise environments.
