# ddd-cebolla
lightweight libraries and samples for building applications following the ideas of ddd and onion architecture


## Goal
The project aims to provide a lightweight, yet powerful libraries for building applications based on the concepts of 
domain-driven design and following the onion architecture approach. The ddd-cebolla libraries aim to stay as 
non-invasive and technology-independent as possible, while still providing out-of-the-box support for all relevant 
architectural concepts of tactical domain-driven design.
