= Introduction and Goals

== Motivation

This sample application is provided for demonstrating and validating the concepts provided by the ddd-cebolla framework.

== Use Cases

The following use cases are part of the sample application:

[cols="1, 1a,1a,1", options="header"]
|===
| Use Case
| Description
| Concepts
| Status

|
register new user
|
* user signs up using mobile phone number
* mobile phone number must be unique (only one user per mobile phone number)
* user receives sms with verification code
* user completes registration process using sms verification code and by providing user details
|
* aggregate representing multi-step process
* value objects with validation
* unique check on mobile phone number
* infrastructure service for sms service integration
* domain events (within and across bounded contexts)
|
unimplemented

|
view user profile
|
* user views own user profile
* user profile consists of user details, current wallet balance, number of bookings
|
* read model with data from other bounded contexts
|
unimplemented

|
edit user profile
|
* user edits own user profile (user details, mobile phone number)
* when editing mobile phone number, new mobile phone number needs to be verified
* user cannot book bikes until new mobile phone number has been verified
|
* mutable aggregate state
* input validation
* multi-step process for changing mobile phone number
* domain events for modified aggregate state
|
unimplemented

|
deactivate user
|
* fleet manager searches / selects user from list
* fleet manager deactivates user
|
* read model with search
* status change on aggregate
* domain events
|
unimplemented

|
charge minutes on wallet
|
* user selects minutes package
* user pays minutes via credit card
* after successful payment, minutes are charged to wallet
|
* integration of external service with state / lifecycle
* idempotency for payment events received from external system
* domain events
|
unimplemented

|
add bike to fleet
|
* fleet manager enters bike details (vin, type, size, color, number plate)
* vin and bike number plate must be unique
* bike is added to fleet and gets bookable
|
* input validation
* unique check on vin / bike number plate
* domain events
|
unimplemented

|
remove bike from fleet
|
* fleet manager selects bike from list
* fleet manager removes bike from fleet
* removed bike is no longer bookable
|
* destruction of data still referenced by historic data
* domain events
|
unimplemented

|
view list of bookable bikes / bike details
|
* user views list of bookable bikes
* user selects bike from list
* user views bike details
|
* read model with master/detail view
|
unimplemented

|
start booking
|
* user selects bike from list
* user starts booking
* booking can only be started, if bike is bookable, user is active and user has minutes on wallet
* once booking is started, booked bike is no longer available for booking by other users
|
* business condition validation based on data from other bounded contexts
* handling of contingency on limited resources (bike)
|
unimplemented

|
lock / unlock bike
|
* user locks / unlocks bike
* user can only lock / unlock currently booked bike
* lock status is reflected in bike details
* in case of failure, lock / unlock is retried (until successful)
|
* idempotency (locking already locked bike)
* ordering of dependent actions / events (lock-unlock-lock sequences)
* infrastructure service for communication with bike
* retry handling and potentially long-running "commands"
|
unimplemented

|
end booking
|
* user ends booking
* user can only end own active booking
* booking duration (rounded on minutes) is deducted from wallet
* minimum fare is 1 minute
* after 10 minutes duration, 10% discount applies on additional minutes
|
* business logic for fare calculation
* idempotency for fare deduction
* reference to data from other bounded contexts
|
unimplemented

|
update bike status
|
* bike status (position, lock status) is updated based on updates received from bike
* if bike status cannot be updated for 30 minutes, bike is marked as unreachable
* if bike status is received, bike is marked as reachable
*
|
* polling for external status
* update of status received from external systems
* timer for handling bike reachability
|
unimplemented

|
view booking history
|
* user views history of own bookings
* booking shows bike details, start/end position, booking duration, fare
*
|
* read model with data from other bounded contexts
|
unimplemented

|
generate usage report
|
* fleet manager chooses date range and generates csv report
* report shows bookings with user details, bike reference, booking duration, fare
|
* read model with data from other bounded contexts
* report generation with bulk data
|
unimplemented

== Out-Of-Scope

The following aspects are currently not within the scope of the sample application:

* user authentication
* authorization of actions and data visibility
